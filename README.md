# DevOps Introduction

DevOps word in itself is a combination of two words one is Development and other is Operations. It is neither an application nor a tool, instead, it is just a culture to promote development and Operation process collaboratively.
DevOps is a Software Development approach which involves Continuous Development, Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring of the software through its development lifecycle.

## Evolution of Software development:

a) Traditional Waterfall Method
b) Agile Methodology
c) DevOps Approach

Mostly they followed waterfall methodology/model for Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

There were few disadvantages using Traditional Waterfall Method such as High amount of risk and uncertainity, Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.

Hence, they started adapting Agile Methodolgy which helps to launch products faster into the market.There are also few other reasons such as Predictability, Reproducibility, Maintainability etc.

DevOps allows Agile Development Teams to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Now, they follow two different approaches i.e; Agile Method and DevOps approach.Agile and DevOps both aim towards delivering quality software in a timely manner.

The difference between Agile and DevOps is that Agile focuses on optimizing the development life-cycle, while DevOps unites development and operations in a CI/CD environment.
