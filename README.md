# DevOps Introduction

DevOps word in itself is a combination of two words one is Development and other is Operations. It is neither an application nor a tool, instead, it is just a culture to promote development and Operation process collaboratively.

DevOps is a Software Development approach which involves Continuous Development, Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring of the software through its development lifecycle.

## Evolution of Software development:

a) Traditional Waterfall Method
b) Agile Methodology
c) DevOps Approach

Mostly they followed waterfall methodology/model for Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

There were few disadvantages using Traditional Waterfall Method such as High amount of risk and uncertainity, Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.

Hence, they started adapting Agile Methodolgy which helps to launch products faster into the market.There are also few other reasons such as Predictability, Reproducibility, Maintainability etc.

DevOps allows Agile Development Teams to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Now, they follow two different approaches i.e; Agile Method and DevOps approach.Agile and DevOps both aim towards delivering quality software in a timely manner.

The difference between Agile and DevOps is that Agile focuses on optimizing the development life-cycle, while DevOps unites development and operations in a CI/CD environment.

DevOps is an extension of Agile built around the practices that are not in Agile’s focus. When used together, both practices improve software development and lead to better products.

Both uses different tools such as Agile uses: Kanban board, JIRA, Active Collab, Bugzilla, Slack, Trello and DevOps uses: AWS, Puppet, OpenStack, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, Kubernetes, GitLab/GitHub.

### GIT & GITHUB

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.

Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

It has a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.

Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

GitHub is a web based service for version control for software development project. It was named after the version management system Git.

In simple words Git is a CLI(Command Line Interface) tool to communicate with Github from local system/machine. 

### VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later when ever required.  

There are two types of VCS:
•	Centralized Version Control Systems
•	Distributed Version Control Systems

Git uses Distributed Version Control Systems with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. 

Distributed VCS: These system have a single server which acts as a central storage and all the developers will have a copy in local with all the versioned files. Thereby developer can work without relying on server during the code development.
