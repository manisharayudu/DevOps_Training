**GIT & GITHUB**

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.

Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

It has a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.

Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

*GitHub* is a web based service for version control for software development project. It was named after the version management system Git.

In simple words Git is a CLI(Command Line Interface) tool to communicate with Github from local system/machine.

**VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM**

Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later when ever required.

There are two types of VCS:

• Centralized Version Control Systems 

• Distributed Version Control Systems

Git uses Distributed Version Control Systems with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

*Distributed VCS*: These system have a single server which acts as a central storage and all the developers will have a copy in local with all the versioned files. Thereby developer can work without relying on server during the code development.
